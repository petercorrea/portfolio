				<h3>Greetings</h3>
				<p>Hi, I'm Peter! I noticed Apple was hiring software developers and decied to reachout and connect.</p>

				<h3>Who I am</h3>
				<p>
					As a full-stack software engineer, I work at a product
					studio designing bespoke solutions for medium and
					large-sized businesses. Currently I am working as employee No.2 at Bastion Digital where I led efforts in 
					React Development and SE best practices. My role also involves discussing the
					scope and goal of each solution, sharing the tradeoffs
					between different implementations, establishing milestones,
					collaborating with designers, and deploying high-quality
					code. Ultimately, my role is to improve lives and impact
					companies through software. Proficient with JavaScript,
					TypeScript, HTML, SCSS, React, ReactNative, Node, Express,
					GraphQL, SQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Git/GitHub, Docker,
					Kubernetes, Webpack, Amazon Web Services, Heroku, and
					Vercel.
				</p>

				<h3>My Background</h3>
				<p>After completing my degree is business analytics I went to become an operational manager for a 
					big box retailer where I ran a team of 8. My biggest responsibility included rolling out 
					online channels for ordering, curbside pickup, and same day delivery fulfillment. 
					During a search for new and better technology I decided to learn Python and Data Science 
					to help create my own reporting tools. Ultimately I completed a Data Science career track 
					with DataCamp which officially sparked my passion for software! I felt ready for a career 
					change and completed Thinkful's 8 month long software engineering bootcamp. 
				</p>

				<h3>Away From Keyboard</h3>
				<p>
					When I'm not working on products, I'm leading teams,
					managing talent, and driving operations. I'm an autodidact
					and a classically trained saxophonist. I have interests in
					data science üé≤, cryptography üîê, dev ops, language design,
					complexity theory üìì, minimalism, and enjoy podcasts üéô. I'm
					currently leveraging python and scikit-learn to build an
					image classifier with neural networks and a recommendation
					engine for matching like users. When not in front of a
					computer, you can find me meditating üßòüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è, playing off the
					Omnibook üé∑, or out on a run üèÉüèª.
				</p>
